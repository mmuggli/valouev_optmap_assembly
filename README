Anton Valouev, David C. Schwartz, Shiguo Zhou, and Michael S. Waterman. "An algorithm for assembly of ordered restriction maps from single DNA molecules"  October 24, 2006.  PNAS. no. 43 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0604040103 vol. 103   


This tool doesn't quite take the output of the aligner.  Two tools in the contrib directory help fill in the gaps.

Compile with g++ assmbly.cc

   $ valuev_optmap_assembly/contrib/gen_skipped.py sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.valuev sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.ovlps sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.skipped
   $ valuev_optmap_assembly/contrib/patchin_hash_keys.py sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.valuev sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.ovlps sim_ecoli_XhoI_rev.ovlps.patched
   $ valuev_optmap_assembly/a.out 


The tool is still asserting so there may be more gaps to fill yet.
